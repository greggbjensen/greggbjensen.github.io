## Gregg B. Jensen

I believe that people have more potential then they know. I work hard to bring out the best in people by facilitating a culture that helps them thrive through self-driven action, training, mentoring, and a shared vision. I build the infrastructure to expand and solidify business by leading architecture, creating teams, integrating technologies, and automating systems. With over 15 years of streamlining process and designing enterprise applications from the ground up; my focus is to bring people, process, and technology together into a self-propelling organization.
